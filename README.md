This example demonstrates a common error in F# related to mutability and the way function parameters are handled.  The `swap` function attempts to swap two mutable variables, but due to the way F# handles value parameters, it doesn't work as expected.  The solution shows how to correctly swap mutable variables within a function using a helper function or by passing mutable references.
